My name is Vincent.

For I handed down to you [b]as of first importance what I also received, that
Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried,
and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that
He appeared to [c]Cephas, then to the twelve. 6 After that He appeared to more
than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom remain until
now, but some have fallen asleep; 7 then He appeared to [d]James, then to all
the apostles; 8 and last of all, as [e]to one untimely born, He appeared to me
also. 9 For I am the least of the apostles, [f]and not fit to be called an
apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 10 But by the grace of God I am
what I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more
than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me. 11 Whether then it
was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
